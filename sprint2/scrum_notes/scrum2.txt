Scrum Meeting 2

Scrum master: Zac Denham

Sprint Planning:

Note: Sprint 2 ends April 17th

We only have completed 15% thus far, we want to step it up and get to 70% completion by the end of the third sprint so we have lots of time to squash bugs and refactor code in the third sprint.

Come up with a new sprint backlog:

With this ambitious attitude in mind, we want to accomplish the following stories from our product back log this sprint:

* Clickable word clouds
* Link to download from digital library
* Provide a Link to access bibles
* Show a status bar for the current progress
* Author search from author list
* conference paper list
* clickable title shows abstract
* Export list of papers as PDF and plain text
* access previous searches

We will a screenshot of the subtasks of these stories.
