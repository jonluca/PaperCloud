At 10:36 AM on 3/29, JonLuca and Alex met with Professor Halfond to discuss exact Github requirements. While we have already been having our scrum meetings we were *not* keeping notes.

As such, we are now including text recaps of our meetings. We also have photos of our scrums in our photoLog folder. We will provide pictures of conversations, google hangouts history, and screenshots as proof.

Since we have not kept scrum meeting notes up until now, we are doing 3 additional scrums to make up for our lacking notes.
